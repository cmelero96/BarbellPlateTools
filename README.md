# BarbellPlateTools
A simple set of Python tools to find weight combinations available given a (configurable) set of plates.


# How to use
Functionality couldn't be simpler. Just run the .exe file and follow along. It supports both kg and lb units.


TO-DO:
 - Format ouput in #2 so that close values are displayed on the same line (for instance, every 10kg go down a line)
 - Manually remove or add a single pair of plates instead of having to start over. (And recalculate weight combinations, obviously)
 - Add a mode to contact me (the creator). If a gmail/hotmail popup is too complicated, maybe just display my contact info on the terminal.
